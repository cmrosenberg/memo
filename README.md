# Memo

An implementation of the classic Memory/Concentration-game in plain HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Read more about the board game on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)">Wikipedia</a>.

This is strictly an educational project. The goal is to hone my skills in the basic frontend building blocks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I picked the project because it seemed easy to get started with, yet still possible to improve over time (fancy animations, more responsive design, what have you). 

## How do I run it?

Simply open <code>index.html</code> in your browser of choice.
