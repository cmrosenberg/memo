# Memo â€“ an implementation of the classic game using plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS

This is an attempt to make an implementation of the classic game <em>Memo</em>, also called <em>Concentration</em>, <em>Pelmanism</em>, <em>Pairs</em> [etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)).

This is strictly an educational project. The goal is to hone my skills in the basic frontend building blocks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I picked the project because it seemed easy to get started with, yet still possible to improve over time (fancy animations, more responsive design, what have you).
