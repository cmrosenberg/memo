## About

This is strictly an educational project. The goal is to hone my skills in the basic frontend building blocks: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I picked the project because it seemed easy to get started with, yet still possible to improve over time (fancy animations, more responsive design, what have you). 

## How do I run it?

Simply open <code>index.html</code> in your browser of choice.
